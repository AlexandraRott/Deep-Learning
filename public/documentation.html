                        <b>Image classification </b>
                        <p>Upon launching the application in <b>Example images</b> tab, the ml5 model is loaded, setting
                            the stage for user interaction. You'll find six initial images displayed,
                            serving as practical examples. Each of these images can be easily classified
                            by clicking the "CLASSIFY" button.</p>
                        <p></p>Following the classification process, users receive clear details about the
                        top match and its confidence level, providing valuable insights into the system's analysis.</p>
                        <p>For a more tailored experience, users can opt to upload their own images in <b>Upload

                        <h3>Language model implementation</h3>

                        <p>The implementation process began with the selection of a suitable dataset. I chose the
                            English novel "Oliver Twist" by Dickens. Based on this, I created a Python script that:</p>

                        <p>
                            1. Converts the entire text to lowercase<br>
                            2. Places each new sentence on a new line<br>
                            3. Removes all characters except alphabetic characters and spaces<br>
                        </p>

                        <p> As a result, a txt file was obtained with text where all words are in lowercase, separated
                            by spaces, and sentences are separated by line breaks.</p>

                        <p> After this preprocessing, I proceeded to develop my models. I wrote a Python script to
                            create a tokenizer in JSON format based on the aforementioned txt file.</p>

                        <p> Next, scripts were written by me to create and train two models (RNN and FFNN) on the txt
                            file; they were trained for 10 epochs.</p>

                        <p> Since TensorFlow Decision Forest is not supported on Windows, scripts were written to
                            convert the created models to tfjs and run in WSL.</p>

                        <p> Then, I wrote a JS script for use in a new section. It loads two models and predicts the
                            next word based on the entered text, considering the user-selected parameters: model type
                            and the number of suggested words.</p>

                        FFNN - TOP 30</p>

                        <p>Post the trial runs, it was noted that there were no noteworthy variations in the performance
                            of the RNN and FFNN models. Both models demonstrated comparable performance with regard to
                            the assigned tasks and test datasets. It is important to highlight that outcomes might
                            differ for diverse tasks or datasets, and further investigations are needed to ensure the
                            generalizability of these findings.</p>

                        <p>Deep learning language models pose a challenge to data privacy due to their reliance on
                            extensive datasets. In my case, there is no inherent risk as the model was trained on
                            classic literature. However, when training models on data containing personal information,
                            applying meticulous anonymization and privacy-preserving technologies becomes crucial.
                            Transparent communication, obtaining informed consent, and ongoing vigilance contribute to a
                            privacy-centric approach.</p>
