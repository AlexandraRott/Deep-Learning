                        <p>Upon launching the application, the ml5 model is loaded, setting 
                        the stage for user interaction. You'll find six initial images displayed, 
                        serving as practical examples. Each of these images can be easily classified 
                        by clicking the "CLASSIFY" button.</p>
                        <p></p>Following the classification process, users receive clear details about the 
                        top match and its confidence level, providing valuable insights into the system's analysis.</p>
                        <p>For a more tailored experience, users can opt to upload their own images by clicking 
                        the "Upload image" option in the top bar. After uploading and classifying the image, 
                        the system once again provides information about the best match and its confidence level, 
                        ensuring a personalized and informative user journey.</p>

                        <h3>Frameworks</h3>
                        <p><b>Node.js</b> Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment based on the V8 
                        JavaScript engine from Google Chrome. It allows the development of high-performance and 
                        scalable network applications due to its non-blocking I/O architecture. Node.js is particularly 
                        suitable for data-intensive and real-time applications. Developers often utilize Node.js for 
                        creating web applications, APIs, and microservices.</p>
                        <p><b>Express.js</b> Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. 
                        It is based on simple routing and middleware concepts and provides a robust set of features for 
                        developing web and mobile applications. Its modular architecture enables developers to quickly 
                        create APIs and RESTful services. The framework also supports a variety of plugins that facilitate 
                        the development of Node.js applications.</p>
                        <p><b>Multer</b> Multer is middleware for Express.js, specializing in handling file uploads in web 
                        applications. With Multer, users can send files from client-side forms to the server and process 
                        them efficiently. It offers features such as file type validation and the ability to change file 
                        names. Multer simplifies secure file management on the server and seamlessly integrates into Express.js 
                        applications.</p>
                        <p><b>ml5.js</b> ml5.js is a JavaScript library for machine learning built on top of TensorFlow.js. 
                        It provides developers with easy access to machine learning algorithms without requiring extensive 
                        knowledge in the machine learning field. ml5.js offers pre-trained models for various tasks such as 
                        image recognition, text analysis, and speech generation. Developers can integrate these models directly 
                        into web applications or train and implement custom models. The library is frequently used in the 
                        development of interactive creative applications and experiments in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
